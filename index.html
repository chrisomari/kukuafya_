            A Quick Guide to Chicken Health and Disease Prevention.

Raising chickens is an incredibly rewarding venture with numerous benefits. First and foremost, 
chickens provide fresh, organic eggs, rich in nutrients and better tasting than store-bought alternatives.
 Beyond eggs, chickens can be raised for high-quality meat, which is often healthier when raised on a small
  farm compared to commercial sources

                Beak trimming is the removal of part of the top and bottom beak of a bird. It is also called “debeaking”, although this term is inaccurate as only part of the beak is removed. It is an animal husbandry practice commonly carried out in the poultry industry. Farm managers have their flocks beak-trimmed to blunt the beaks enough to prevent the occurrence of damaging pecking. Re-trimming may also be carried out if a bird’s beak grows back enough to cause pecking damage. Birds are often re-trimmed at 8–12 weeks of age to avoid this happening. Some non-trimmed adult birds may need trimming if a pecking outbreak occurs.

                Why is beak trimming done?
                Beak trimming is performed early in the life of commercial hens to decrease injuries caused by cannibalism, bullying, and feather and vent pecking. Birds naturally peck at the environment and each other to investigate and work out where they fit into the flock (pecking order). This behaviour can become a problem in commercial situations and many deaths have been recorded among untrimmed hens. Feather pecking and cannibalism affects all birds in all production systems. When laying birds are kept in systems that give the opportunity for aggressive birds to contact many other birds, cannibalism and feather pecking can spread rapidly through the flock and result in injuries and mortality. Mortality of up to 25–30% of the flock can occur and cause huge mortality and morbidity problems as well as financial losses to the farmer.

                When is beak trimming done?
                Beak trimming is carried out at various ages depending on the preference of the farm manager. The most common ages for birds to be beak-trimmed are:
                
                Day-old (most common)
                <br>5–10 days old</br>
                <br>4–6 weeks</br>
                <br>8–12 weeks</br>
                Touch up trim of adult birds (mainly in alternative systems)
                
                
                
                Who does beak trimming?
                Hot blade beak trimming is performed by contract teams, individual farmers and some large poultry companies. The majority of birds are trimmed by contract teams. Birds must be beak-trimmed by an accredited beak-trimmer to ensure that nationally agreed standards are maintained and the welfare of the birds is not compromised. The infrared treatment machine is installed by the supplier and leased by hatcheries. It is monitored and controlled by the supplier via a communication system and on-site computer.

                6 Common Chicken Health Problems
Some poultry health problems can go virtually undetected for days or weeks on end, while others can kill chickens within a matter of hours. Here are six of the most common health issues chickens face:

<br><b>1. Fowl Cholera</b></br>
Fowl Cholera is a chronic disease caused by Pasteurella Multocida that can affect the joints, wattles, infraohits, sinuses and other tissues. Common symptoms include loss of appetite, diarrhea with a greenish tinge, ruffled feathers, swollen purple wattle, swollen comb, swollen joints, lameness, oral, nasal and ocular discharge and sudden death.

Most commonly found in older chickens, Fowl Cholera affects more cocks than it does hens

<br><b>2. Coccidiosis</b></br>
Coccidiosis is a parasitic disease  caused by Coccidian protozoa that lives in and damages a specific region of the gut in chickens. The trouble starts when chickens consume a sporulated oocyst which is broken down by chemicals in the gut, releasing an infective sporocyst. This begins the life cycle that causes the destruction of intestinal epithelial cells.

Together with damage to the gut walls, it causes loss of appetite, diarrhea, ruffled feathers, weight loss and inability to absorb nutrients.

<br><b></b>3. Avian Influenza</b></br>
Avian influenza is a disease caused by type A Orthomyxoviruses. They are commonly found and spread by wild aquatic birds which infect domesticated poultry. Diarrhea, nasal discharge, edema in the comb and wattles, purple discoloration, coughing and sneezing, swelling, ruffled feathers and more are symptoms of the bird flu.

Once spread, avian influenza is deadly.
<br><b>4. Fowl Pox</b></br>
Also known as Avian Pox, Fowl Pox is highly contagious. Chickens who contract Avian Pox can experience two different types of the condition:

Dry pox
Wet pox
Symptoms are characterized by distinctive bumps that look like warts and are visible on the wattle and comb. In addition, young birds experienced stunted growth and egg production decreases.

<br><b>5. Newcastle Disease</b></br>
Newcastle disease is an acute respiratory disease that can spread rapidly. Symptoms of the disease depends on whether the infecting virus has a predilection for respiratory, digestive, or nervous systems. While it can affect both wild and domesticated fowl, domestic poultry is much more susceptible to contract severe symptoms

<br><b>6. Salmonellosis</b></br>
Salmonellosis is a bacterial disease that can cause septicemia and enteritis in young chickens. With a low mortality rate, infections are contracted orally and can be spread by rodents.

Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, closed eyes, loss of appetite, thirst, ruffled feathers and dejection.

Boosting Immunity
Improving chicken health by using feed supplements and additives that work to optimize the consumption of nutrients. Reducing the microbial load of feed and raw materials, improving digestive function, and restoring healthy populations of gut bacteria can all be accomplished with high-quality additives

                Vaccination plays an important part in the health management of the poultry flock. There are numerous diseases that are prevented by vaccinating the birds against them. A vaccine helps to prevent a particular disease by triggering or boosting the bird’s immune system to produce antibodies that in turn fight the invading causal organisms.

                A natural invasion that actually causes the disease will have the same result as the bird will produce antibodies that fight the current invasion as well as to prevent future invasions by the same causal organisms. Unfortunately, birds that become diseased usually become unthrifty, non-productive or even die. An infection caused by natural invasion will be uncontrolled and therefore has the possibility of causing severe damage, however, vaccination provides a way of controlling the result with minimal harm to the birds.
                
                Vaccines are generally fragile products, some of which are live but in a state of suspended animation. Others are dead. All have a finite life that is governed by the way they are handled and used. Handling and administration procedures also influence the potency of many vaccines and consequently the level of immunity the bird develops.
                
                <br>Types of vaccines</br>
                <br>Live vaccine – the active part of the vaccine is the live organism that causes the disease. As such, it is capable of inducing the disease in birds that have not had previous contact that organism. Vaccinated birds, in many cases, are able to infect non-vaccinated birds if housed together.</br>
                
            <br> Attenuated vaccine – with this type of vaccine the organism has been weakened by special procedures during manufacture so that it has lost its ability to cause the serious form of the disease. At worst, the birds may contract a very mild form of the disease, however, the vaccine still has the ability to trigger the immune system to produce antibodies.</br>
                
        <br> Killed vaccine – with this type of vaccine the organism has been killed and is unable to cause the disease, although the ability to trigger the immune system remains. In many cases, the level of immunity produced by this form of vaccine is weaker than that produced by live and attenuated vaccines.</br>
                
    <br>   Vaccine production</br>
<br>  Vaccines are produced mainly in three forms:</br>
                
                
<br>Avian influenza causing depression Source: CSIRO</br>
<br>Liquid vaccine – it is in a fluid form ready to use.</br>
<br>  Freeze-dried vaccine – the vaccine is stored as one pack of freeze-dried material and one pack of diluent, often a sterile saline solution. These have to be combined before use.</br>
<br>  Dust – where the vaccine is prepared for administration in the dry form.</br>
                Vaccines are sold in dose lots, the number of doses being the number of fowls that may be vaccinated with that amount of vaccine when using the recommended technique. In the case of many vaccines, there are differences in the disease organism strains that they are effective against. It is important that the correct vaccine strain be used and this can only be determined by veterinary advice.
                
            <br> Handling vaccines on the farm</br>
                Vaccines are fragile in many respects and require very careful handling to ensure they retain their potency. Poor handling procedures will, in most cases, result in a rapid decline of potency.
                
            <br>The important handling requirements on the farm are:</br>
                
        <br>   On receipt of the vaccine on the farm, check and record:</br>
                
                That the vaccine has been transported in the recommended manner which is usually in the chilled or frozen state. Prolonged exposure to atmospheric temperature will result in a rapid loss of potency.
            <br> Type of vaccine – is it the vaccine ordered.</br>
        <br>  The number of doses – has the correct amount been delivered.</br>
    <br>    The expiry date of the vaccine – vaccines have a date by when there is a significant risk that they will no longer retain their potency and will not produce the immunity required. The expiry date is based on the vaccine being handled and stored in the recommended manner.</br>
                As soon as possible place the vaccine into recommended storage conditions. Read the instructions to find out what these are. However, freeze-dried material should be kept at a temperature below freezing and its diluent at a temperature just above freezing. Liquid vaccines are generally kept at temperatures just above freezing.
                Remove the vaccines from storage immediately prior to their being used. Only remove and re-constitute enough for immediate needs and repeat this through the day if more is required. Do NOT mix what is required for an entire day at the start of the day and leave it to stand until required, as the vaccine will rapidly lose its efficacy.
                Protect the vaccines after mixing by holding them in an ice bath. Place ice in a small esky or similar container and place the container of the mixed vaccine in the ice. Some vaccines have a very short life once mixed. For example, Marek’s Disease has a life of about 1.5 hours after mixing IF HELD IN AN ICE BATH. It is much shorter if held in higher temperatures.
                Use the recommended administration techniques and do not vary these without veterinary advice.
                Always clean and sterilise the vaccinating equipment thoroughly after use.
                Always destroy unused mixed vaccines after the task has been completed. Some vaccines have the potential to cause harm if not destroyed properly.
                Do not vaccinate birds that are showing signs of disease or stress.
                Vaccination procedures
                There are a number of ways that vaccines may be administered to poultry and it is very important that the correct method is used for each vaccine. To use the wrong method will often result in failure of the vaccine to produce the desired immunity. Some of the methods require the operator to handle every bird and, consequently are time consuming and stressful to the birds and operator. Other methods involve administration by methods much less stressful and time consuming. These methods include administration via the drinking water or as an aerosol spray. The different ways that the vaccines may be administered to poultry are below.
                
                 
                
            <br> In-ovo vaccination</br>
                Using the method of in-ovo vaccination, the vaccine is administered into the embryo before hatch.
                
                In general, vaccines can be applied to five different areas of the egg: the air cell, the allantoic sac, the amniotic fluid, the body of the embryo and the yolk sac. Vaccine uptake and therefore the immune response of the chicken depends largely on the area of injection. While injection in the air cell has been shown to be minor/not effective, injection in the body of the embryo or the allantoic sac is effective. Therefore, the optimum period to inject the embryo is in the late stage of development, i.e. the time between the ascendance of the stalk of the yolk sac into the abdomen (about the time when the chicken tucks its head under its wings) and external pipping.
                
                During that late stage of development, the embryo is mature enough to cope with the viral stimulus and the trauma induced by the penetrating needle is unlikely to cause severe tissue damage. Signs of too early vaccination include reduced hatchability, late death and increased number of culled birds. However, if vaccination is done too late in embryonation, the risk of eggshell breakage is significantly higher. Therefore, in ovo vaccination is commonly performed between days 18-19 of incubation.
                
                The system of a larger outer needle (penetrating the eggshell) that contains an inner needle (penetrating the embryo) enables for strong but careful penetration of the egg and minimizes trauma to the embryo. In addition, the use of two needles reduces the likelihood of transferring contaminants on the outer eggshell into the sterile embryo. The needle for punching the eggshell should not penetrate the embryonic cavity (the inner shell membrane, the chorioallantoic membrane or air cell membrane). While the penetration of the outer eggshell increased the relative pore volume about 30%, the risk for increased gas exchange of the embryo occurs.
                
                Hygiene management including reduced air circulation, well maintained air filters, adjustment to weather conditions and well maintained hatchery insulation has to be taken into account when performing in ovo inoculation. Only strict management of these environmental factors can reduce the likelihood of infections of the egg, especially with aspergillosis or other air-borne pathogens. Continuous training of reliable staff is of the highest priority to prevent reduced hatchability and to maintain high hygienic standards. A sterile environment and the usage of chlorine based sanitizers are crucial. The storage and preparation of the vaccine in a separate biosecure area as well as strict precautions in using sterile devices such as containers and water should be implemented. While the cost of machine acquisition is high, the investment can pay back by its advantages.
                
                The advantage of commencing immunity development before hatch can prevent young chicks from early infection after hatch. Since high tech machines are used for in ovo injection, the volume and concentration of the vaccine to be administered are highly standardised, reducing human error and labour cost when compared to vaccination of chickens later in life. Furthermore, vaccination of every single chicken can be ensured resulting in better uniformity of the flock. Coming with this is improved animal welfare due to less handling of birds later in life.
                
                Currently, Marek’s disease, Newcastle disease, infectious laryngotracheitis and infectious bursal disease vaccines are routinely administered using in ovo vaccination in various countries. In ovo vaccination does not interfere with maternal antibodies that may still present in the embryo. In fact, it increases the level of immunity and as a consequence one injection is sufficient to offer life-long protection against the target disease.
                
                 
                
            <br> Intramuscular injection</br>
                This method involves the use of a hypodermic needle or similar equipment to introduce the vaccine into the muscle (usually the breast muscle) of the bird. The task is sped up greatly by the use of an automatic syringe which makes the technique relatively easy and doesn’t harm the bird. Care must be taken to ensure that the correct dose is administered to each chicken and the equipment should be checked regularly to ensure this.
                
                Care must be taken to ensure that the needle does not pass through into a key organ and that other unwanted organisms are not administered to the bird at the same time by contaminated vaccine or equipment. Contamination can be prevented by good hygiene and vaccine handling procedures.
                
                 
                
            <br> Subcutaneous injection</br>
                This method involves the use of similar equipment to that used for the intramuscular technique. The main difference between the two techniques is that, in this case, the vaccine is injected under the skin, usually at the back of the neck, and not into the muscle. Care must be taken to ensure that the vaccine is injected into the bird and not just into the feathers or fluff in the case of very young chickens. The dose being administered should be checked for accuracy frequently. Maintain good hygiene practices to limit introducing contaminating organisms during the procedure.
                
                 
                
            <br>  Ocular</br>
                This method involves the vaccine being put into one of the bird’s eyes. From here the vaccine makes its way into the respiratory tract via the lacrimal duct. The vaccine is delivered through an eyedropper and care must be taken to ensure that the dropper delivers the recommended dose. If it is too little, the level of immunity may be inadequate, while if too much, the vaccine may not treat the total flock but will run out beforehand.
                
                 
                
            <br>  Nasal</br>
                This method involves introducing the vaccine into the birds’ nostrils either as a dust or as a drop. Always ensure that the applicator delivers the correct dose for the vaccine being used.
                
                 
                
            <br>  Oral</br>
                With this method, the vaccine dose is given in the mouth. From here it may make its way to the respiratory system or it may continue in the digestive tract before entering the body.
                
                 
                
            <br>Drinking water</br>
                With this method the vaccine is added to the drinking water and, as a consequence, is less time consuming and is significantly less stressful on the birds and operator. Take care to ensure the vaccine is administered correctly as there is much scope for error. The recommended technique observes the following:
                
                All equipment used for vaccination is carefully cleaned and free of detergents and disinfectants
                Only cold, clean water of drinking quality should be used
                Open the stopper of vaccine bottle underwater
                The water present in the drinking trough should be consumed before vaccination
                By ensuring that all birds drink during the vaccination phase, all should receive an adequate dose of the vaccine
                 
                
            <br> Cloacal</br>
                This method involves the introduction of the vaccine to the mucus membranes of the cloaca with an abrasive applicator. The applicator is firstly inserted into the vaccine and then into the bird’s cloaca and turned or twisted vigorously to cause an abrasion in the organ. The vaccine enters the body through the abrasion. The technique is time consuming and stressful to the birds and care must be taken to ensure no contamination is introduced with the vaccine particularly from bird to bird. As a rule, the technique is not used on commercial farms.
                
                 
                
            <br>Feather follicle</br>
                With this method, the vaccine is introduced into the feather follicles (the holes in the skin from where the feathers grow). The technique involves the removal of a group of adjacent feathers or fluff in young chickens, and the brushing of the vaccine into the empty follicles with a short, stiff-bristled brush. Good hygiene is necessary to prevent the introduction of contaminant organisms with the vaccine.
                
                 
                
            <br>  Wing stab</br>
                With this method, the vaccine is introduced into the wing by a special needle(s). These needles have a groove along their length from just behind the point. When dipped into the vaccine some of the vaccine remains on the needle to fill the groove. The needle(s) are then pushed through the web just behind the leading edge of the wing and just out from its attachment to the body of the bird. Care must be taken to select a site free of muscle and bone to prevent undue injury to the bird. Ensure that the needles penetrate the layers of skin at the ideal site. A common problem is for the vaccine to be brushed from the needles by fluff or feathers before it is brushed into the follicles.
                
                 
                
            <br>  Spray</br>
                With this method, the vaccine is sprayed onto the chickens (or into the air above the chickens) using a suitable atomiser spray. The vaccine then falls onto the chickens and enters the body of other chickens as they pick at the shiny droplets of vaccine. A small quantity may be inhaled as well.
                
            <br>  Monitoring</br>
                
                In the case of some vaccines, an important part of the procedure is to ascertain whether the vaccine has worked, or “taken”. A good example of this is fowl pox vaccine, which is administered by wing stab. Within 7 to 10 days after vaccination, a “take” should appear at the vaccination site. This is in the form of a small pimple one half to one centimetre in diameter. If the take is larger and has a cheesy core, it indicates that contaminants have been introduced either with the vaccine or with dirty vaccinating equipment. A check for takes would involve inspecting approximately 100 birds for every 10,000 vaccinated.
                
                Another example of whether the birds are reacting satisfactorily to the vaccination is the systemic reaction found in chickens vaccinated against infectious bronchitis disease. In many cases, the birds react approximately 5 to 7 days after vaccination by showing signs of ill health such as slight cough, a higher temperature and lethargy. In cases where there are no obvious signs of success, blood samples may be taken and sent to the laboratory for examination. The usual test is for the presence of an adequate number of the appropriate antibodies (called the titre) in the blood. If the vaccination has been unsuccessful, it may be necessary to re-vaccinate to obtain the desired protection.
                
            <br> Failure to find evidence of success could be because of:</br>
                
                Faulty technique resulting in the vaccine not being introduced into the vaccination site.
                Faulty vaccine – too old or not stored or mixed correctly. It would be unusual but not impossible for the vaccine to be faulty from manufacture.
                The birds are already immune i.e. the immune system has already been triggered as a result of parental (passive) immunity, previous vaccination or other exposure to the causal organism.

               <b><br>Biosecurity for Backyard Poultry Production</br></b>
                The increasing popularity of backyard poultry production as either a hobby or a means of alleviating poverty in lesser developed countries has recently received increasing interest. Village and backyard poultry production have become an essential aspect of daily survival in countries such as South Africa and the Pacific Islands. For this reason, biosecurity is of utmost importance in protecting flocks from deadly diseases and by safeguarding valuable economic investments and community development.
                
                Depending on the circumstances, if live birds (chicks) are purchased it is essential that birds of different species or age are never mixed, due to the varying immune abilities of different breeds and ages (deGraft Hanson, 2002). What one bird/breed may be immune to may be deadly to another. Housing cleanliness and hygiene is essential in curbing disease spread. Litter must be kept clean and dry at all times, wet or dirty litter can contribute to pathogen development which can result in such diseases as “breast blisters and footpad dermatitis” (deGraft Hanson, 2002).
                
                By following strict routine and biosecurity practices (see above) including maintaining basic record sheets (eggs-laid, mortality, feed-consumed) the backyard/village producer will also be able to observe when a disease agent may have penetrated the flock. As implementing biosecurity is the most cost effective disease prevention means available, by following these three simple rules: “Isolation, Traffic Control & Sanitation” (Jeffrey), the producer should effectively be able to minimise any preventable disease outbreaks. It is also important never to share tools or equipment or accept birds 
                from neighbours (deGraft-Hanson). By effectively separating birds in an enclosure, the likelihood of them coming into contact with pathogen carrying animals or these animals accessing the flock can significantly be reduced. Though wild-birds present
                 a direct threat to biosecurity, it is essential to ensure that household pets do not come into contact with the flock. It is also necessary that the producer remember to disinfect their hands/clothing and shoes after being in direct contact with other livestock and family pets (deGraft-Hansona). Sanitation is highly important to successful disease control. Choosing an effective sanitation product to curb disease development depends on the producer’s individual circumstances (such as cost, transport & degree of operation). Sanitation (disinfectant) products can be broken up into:
                
                <br>Phenols</br>
                <br>Hypochlorites (chlorine)</br>
                <br> Iodophors (iodine)</br>
                <br> Quaternary ammonium</br>
                <br>Formaldehyde gas</br>
                <br>Formaldehyde powder</br>
                <br>Alkali (lye)</br>
                <br>Chlorhexidine (Nolvasan)</br>
                
                
                In choosing a sanitation product it is important to consider what type of surface each is best suited for. Phenol is an effective agent in controlling disease growth in organic environments, or in other words “dirty environments”, whereas Hypochlorites and Iodophors are better suited to sanitise processing areas such as benches, walls & foot-baths (Jeffrey). It is recommended that the producer seek professional advice on which sanitiser is best suited for their production needs.
                
                An effective pest control program is important to guarantee the success of backyard and village poultry biosecurity. As rodents, in particular rats & mice, are attracted to poultry feed combined with their ability to enter even the most well fenced off areas, baiting is as important to biosecurity as is good sanitisation (deGraft-Hansona).
                
                Early detection and effectively being able to identify contagious disease outbreaks is very important in implementing harm minimisation action. Though biosecurity measures might appear to be functioning soundly, the imminent risk of disease outbreak does not diminish. IMMEDIATE action to further prevent the disease from spreading MUST be taken (including quarantining visibly affected birds and contacting a Veterinarian or poultry expert) should the flock at any time demonstrate any of the following symptoms:
                
                <br>Lack of energy and appetite</br>
                <br>Decreased egg production</br>
                <br>Soft-shelled eggs or misshapen eggs</br>
                <br>Swelling of the head, eyes, comb, wattles and hocks</br>
                <br>Purple discolouration of the wattles, combs and legs</br>
                <br>Nasal discharge</br>
                <br>Coughing, wheezing and sneezing</br>
                <br>Lack of coordination in mobility</br>
                <br>Diarrhea</br>
                <br>Sudden or excessive mortality without clinical signs</br>
                <br>(Cunningham & Fairchild, 2009)</br>

                Risk from human movement
                As people are considered to be one of the biggest risks insofar as carrying poultry diseases onto chicken farms, particularly on their footwear, clothing, hands and even vehicles, growers take a number of measures to minimise the risks they pose.
                
                
                <br>Quarantine sign at entrance to poultry farm (Source: ACMF)</br>
                <br>These may include:</br>
                
                Signage and gates at access points to the farm to discourage/prevent unauthorised entry to the farm
                Visitors and service providers to the farm must wear overalls and boots provided by the farmer;
                Provision of foot washing baths at the entrance of each shed for disinfection of footwear prior to shed entry
                Vehicle movements onto the farm are minimised, and vehicles or equipment that may have visited another farm may be required to be washed down before entry
                Where people or vehicles must move between farms on the same day without thorough disinfection between farm visits, movements are scheduled such that the youngest flocks are visited first and the oldest last.
                As wild birds can carry some diseases onto the farm, a number of measures are taken to minimise the possibility of wild birds (or their droppings) coming in contact with the chicken flock. These measures include:
                
                wire netting the sheds so that they are bird proof;
                farmers (and their employees) are not allowed to keep any birds as pets;
                wild birds are discouraged from visiting the farm site, by ensuring that there is no spilled feed left lying around and, where practical, no dams that attract water birds;
                where the water that supplies the shed could be contaminated by wild birds eg dam or river water, it must be sanitised.
                Disease prevention
                Farmers have a documented pest control program to reduce the risk of diseases being carried on to the farm by rodents. Strict records are kept by the farmer of the chickens’ health, growth and behaviour so that any emerging disease problem is rapidly identified and acted upon.
                
                Disease prevention is an essential strategy for poultry producers. It is much more beneficial to the birds and to the commercial poultry producer to prevent disease from occurring rather than to rely on treatment. The agents which sound biosecurity practices attempt to prevent include “bacteria, viruses, protozoa, fungi, parasites, and any other agents capable of introducing an infectious disease into a poultry flock” (deGraft-Hansona).
                
                
                <br>Breeding stock </br>
                General husbandry
                Healthy, unstressed birds have an active metabolism and effective immune system to protect them against disease. Feeding birds appropriately with a nutritionally balanced diet, maintaining a comfortable living environment and minimising fear and anxiety in the birds will help the bird’s natural protective mechanisms to function optimally.
                
                 
                
                <br>Stock selection</br>
                Different genetic lines of poultry may vary in their ability to resist or recover from some diseases. The choice of genetic lines resistant to disease problems that have been known to occur in a particular poultry operation can substantially reduce the costs of disease and other disease prevention techniques.
                
                 
               
                
                <b><br>VACCINATION</br></b>

                Vaccines aid in preventing disease by stimulating the bird’s immune system in such a way that it enhances the immune response when the bird is subsequently exposed to a pathogen (or disease-causing organism). Classically, vaccines have either contained a small live dose of a weak form of the pathogen or a larger dose of a killed preparation of the disease-causing organism. The weak forms of pathogens used in live vaccines can either be naturally occurring or can be developed in a laboratory. If they have been developed they are called attenuated vaccines. Live vaccines tend to give longer immunity than killed vaccines because the live organism can colonise and survive in the host for some time and stimulate a longer and more effective immune response. New technologies are leading to improved methods of developing vaccines. These include more efficient methods for identifying the ways organisms cause disease and stimulate an immune response in the host, as well as highly specific and effective attenuation procedures.

        <b><br> 1.Poultry breeding</br></b>
            Poultry breeding is done by a wide range of people for diverse end uses and purposes. Poultry breeding can be divided into three main areas which include:
            
        <b></br> 2. Commercial breeding</br></b>
            Chicken is by far the most popular poultry species utilised by Australians for both meat and egg production. Breeding for the commercial poultry sector is on a large industrial scale and hatcheries supply both the broiler and layer industries. In Australia, the term “broiler” or “meat chicken” is used by the industry to describe a chicken grown for meat, while the term “layer” is used for chickens grown and maintained for egg production. Chickens are also affectionately referred to as “chooks”. Other poultry species such as Turkeys, Ducks & Geese, and game birds such as Quails are also produced in Australia for meat. Emus and Ostriches are also bred for commercial purposes.
            
        <b></br>3.  Village/Backyard breeding</br></b>
            Many farmers and some suburban householders still like to keep their own poultry for egg and meat production. Most of them buy commercial crossbred hens at the point of lay and keep them in semi-intensive conditions in the yard. Some use small colony cages or even use a few layer cages in a protected spot. Others buy day-old chicks and rear their own birds.
            
        <b><br>4. Fancy/Exhibition breeding</br></b>
            There are many breeds of poultry which play very little part in the commercial poultry industry. These are called fancy poultry and are usually kept by small producers (or fanciers) who enjoy breeding, showing and exchanging birds with other fanciers.
            
        <b> </br>5. Commercial poultry breeding</br></b>
            
            Scientific research is a fundamental component of the poultry industry
            The poultry industry breeds chickens destined for both commercial egg and meat production. Geneticists design special breeding programs to select birds with the best characteristics for egg or meat production. This selection process (called genetic selection or genetics) allows the industry to select strains of birds which are produced very efficiently in intensive housing systems. There are two main types of commercial chicken breeds: layers and meat (broiler) chickens.
            
             
            
        <b><br>6. Forming an egg</br></b>
            The hen releases a yolk with the egg cell in it from her ovary where it moves into the oviduct (egg production tube). When a cockerel and a hen are mated, the sperm cells from the cockerel fertilise the egg cell at the top of the oviduct (fertilisation is the joining of the female egg cell with the male sperm cell). The fertilised egg yolk then takes 23-26 hours to pass down the oviduct, during which time layers of egg white (albumen) are laid down. Two layers of egg membranes are then overlaid, and finally the eggshell. If an egg is not fertilised, it still goes through the same process in the oviduct but it will not develop into a chick.
            
        <b> <br> 7. The egg</br></b>
            Although the surface of the egg is covered with bacteria, it has its own protective mechanisms in place to prevent the bacteria spoiling the egg. These are:
            
            The egg cools off after it is laid and bacteria are less able to grow at lower temperatures.
            The shell is coated with a fine moist layer called the cuticle, which dries and protects the egg contents from invading bacteria. This also gives a pleasing appearance, or bloom, to the fresh egg.
            Most eggs are laid in the morning. Eggs are collected as soon as possible after laying and placed in a cool room to help preserve their internal quality. Fertile eggs can be stored for up to 7 days at about 12-15oC without loss of hatchability. Because of the danger of bacteria on egg shells going to the hatchery, all fertile eggs are fumigated on the farm or as soon as they arrive at the hatchery. Fumigation with the gas formaldehyde kills surface bacteria without damaging the fertilised ovum inside the egg.
            
            
        <b> <br>8. Hatchery</br></b>
            Hatchery
            The hatchery is a special building with controlled ventilation. It contains machines for holding and incubating a large number of eggs. The hatchery is designed with hygiene in mind and is laid out so that there is little chance of any contaminating organisms travelling back from hatched chicks to eggs brought in later.
            
             
            
        <b> <br>9. Stages of incubation</br></b>
            First Stage of Incubation
            The first stage lasts for 18 days and is called “setting”. During setting, the eggs are placed on special trays which can be tilted through 90 degrees, from side to side. The temperature and humidity of the air in the setter is controlled so that conditions inside each egg are suitable for the growth and development of the chick.
            
        <b> <br>10. Second Stage of Incubation</br></b>
            On the 18th day, eggs are transferred to a different tray, which cannot be tilted, and placed in another machine called a “hatcher”. Eggs are transferred to hatchers so that hatching chicks do not contaminate other batches of eggs being incubated. The hatchers can then be thoroughly cleaned after every hatch. By the end of the 21st day, all chicks have hatched and are ready to be removed from the machine. They are taken to a special room and removed from the hatcher tray. They are then placed in chick boxes (usually up to 100 in a box) ready for delivery to a farm.
            
             
            
        <b>  <br> 11. Candling of eggs</br></b>
            Candling of eggs is done after 5-8 days of incubation to examine for the presence of any infertile eggs. It is the easiest way to check on the development of the chicks inside the eggs.
            
             
            
            
        <b> <br>12.  Hatching chick</br></b>
            Chick sexing
            Sexing allows separation of male and female chicks. This can be done by:
            
            Visual examination, (called vent sexing) either by checking the structures in the chick’s vent with the naked eye or by inspecting the internal sexual organs with a special lamp.
            Most breeds can now be sexed by checking the feather colour or the degree of growth of wing feathers. Genetic selection has been carried out to ensure that these differences between sexes are distinctive.
            Layer chicks are always sexed, as the females are kept while the males are killed. Breeders are usually sexed, as a greater number of females to males are kept for breeding purposes. Meat chickens are normally left unsexed, as both sexes are usually reared together.
            
            
            Day old chicks
        <b> <br> Other procedures</br></b>
            
            Some vaccines can be administered in the hatchery. In meat chickens, all the required vaccines are administered in the hatchery before delivery to a farm. Beak trimming is sometimes carried out and in some breeds, the comb of the cockerels is trimmed (called dubbing). These procedures may seem cruel but they are carried out to prevent further injury later in life. Beak trimming is done in layer chicks to prevent pecking other birds, or cannibalism. Dubbing is done to prevent injuries to the comb which can result from fighting.
            
             
            
        <b> <br>13.  Chick requirements</br></b>
            The baby chick must be kept warm as it does not have the ability to maintain a constant body temperature. The chicks are transported in chick boxes which are designed to conserve heat while allowing air movement. The room where chicks are held in the hatchery and the truck which delivers them to the farm are also designed to keep the chicks both warm  (32-34oC) and ventilated. There is enough food and water in the yolk to keep the chicks alive for about three days, but best results are obtained if they can eat and drink as soon as possible. When placed on the farm, they must be kept warm and have feed and water available at all times.
            
        <b> <br>  Breeder farm sequence</br></b>
            The breeder farm produces fertile eggs that will be hatched in a hatchery.
            
        <b> <br>  14.  Brooding</br></b>
            Male and female chicks are usually reared separately until about 4-5 weeks of age. They are then reared together so that they can work out who is boss (adjust the pecking order), which means they will be less likely to fight with one another later on.
            
        <b>  <br> 15.Growing</br></b>
            The growing period for layer breeders is from five to 20 weeks of age and is about four weeks less than for meat breeders. During the growing period, feed is restricted to avoid overconsumption and, for layer breeders, to improve egg production. It is even more important for meat breeders because they become too fat to breed efficiently if on full feed. Restricted feeding begins at about six weeks of age and continues until birds have commenced laying. When birds are at 5-10% egg production, a breeder ration is supplied. Birds that have been grown on restricted feed are often called ‘control fed’.
            
            
         Broiler breeder chicks
        <b> <br>16. Housing</br></b>
            Chickens reared for breeding purpose are usually raised on litter floors similar to those used for meat chickens. They are transferred to specially designed breeder sheds, also with litter floors, at approximately 18-22 weeks of age. The sheds are usually divided into small sections which are suitable for about 200 hens to minimise fighting. Nests are placed in the shed, usually in the centre, so that the hens are attracted to the dark areas of the nest to lay their eggs.
            
             
            
            
        <b>  <br>17. Mating</br></b>
            Cockerels will mate with a number of hens and about 10% of cockerels to a group of hens is enough to achieve excellent fertility rates. A surplus of cockerels (15%) is placed at first and they are culled down to 11% at maturity to allow a loss of 1% over their lives. Cockerels can be fed a cheaper diet than hens and it’s a common practice to have additional cockerel feeders placed at a greater height than feeders containing hen feed.
            
        <b> <br>18.Collection</br></b>
            Fertile eggs are collected as soon as possible after laying for reasons of hygiene (if the eggs are left in the nests for too long a time they are more likely to have manure spread on them or be damaged). Regular collection also protects the eggs from the heat of the day. Although it is best not to clean eggs at all, eggs can be cleaned when collected by wiping with a dry cloth or steel wool. Wet cleaning is undesirable as it removes the protective cuticle from the shell. Fumigation by formaldehyde gas is carried out as soon as possible after collection, usually at the farm or sometimes at the hatchery, to kill surface bacteria without damaging the egg.
            
            
            
        <b> <br> 19.Healthy chicks</br></b>
            
            Incubation and hatching
            Eggs are set in trays marked with the shed of origin so that any problems can be traced back to the source. Hatching performance is also closely monitored and the end product is a healthy chick which goes on to become a commercial layer or meat chicken.

              Comprehensive Guide on feeding additives and formulations
    
            </span>
            <span id="full-text-nutrition" style="display: none;">
                <b><br> Feed Formulation</br></b>
                Feed formulation is the process of quantifying the amounts of feed ingredients that need to be combined to form a single uniform mixture (diet) for poultry that supplies all of their nutrient requirements. Since feed accounts for 65-75% of total live production costs for most types of poultry throughout the world, a simple mistake in diet formulation can be extremely expensive for a poultry producer.
                
            <br> Feed formulation requires a thorough understanding of the:</br>
                
        <br>  (a) nutrient requirements of the class of poultry (e.g., egg layers, meat chickens or breeders);</br>
                
    <br>  (b) feed ingredients in terms of nutrient composition and constraints in terms of nutrition and processing, and</br>
                
    <br>   (c) cost and availability of the ingredients.</br>
                
                Most large-scale poultry farmers have their own nutritionists and feed mills, whereas small operations usually depend on consultant nutritionists and commercial feed mills for their feeds. It is therefore essential that formulations are accurate because once feeds are formulated and manufactured, it is often too late to remedy any mistakes or inaccuracies without incurring significant expenses.
    
                <b><br> Feed Additives</br></b>
                Growth promoting hormones are not used in the poultry industry. The efficient growth and egg productivity of commercial poultry has been achieved over the last 50 years through traditional animal breeding techniques (genetic selection – not genetic engineering) and improved nutrition and management (including health and housing) practices.

              <li><strong>chickens have different nutritional needs at each stage of life</strong> 
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Chicks (0-6 weeks):</strong> High-protein starter feed (18-20%) is essential for growth. This can be given as crumbles, which are easier for chicks to consume.</li>
                  <li><strong>Growing pullets (6-20 weeks):</strong>Transition to a grower feed with a slightly lower protein content (15-18%) and fewer calories to prevent rapid growth.</li>
                  <li><strong>Layers (20+ weeks): </strong> Once chickens start laying, switch to a layer feed rich in calcium (about 16-18% protein). This aids shell formation and overall egg production. Supplement with calcium sources like oyster shells or crushed eggshells if needed.</li>

                </ul>
              </li>
             
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong>  Fresh, clean water should be available at all times, and supplements like grit can help with digestion, especially for free-range chickens.</p>

              <li><strong>Biosecurity: </strong>Limit visitors to your coop, sanitize equipment regularly, and avoid introducing new birds without quarantine (2-3 weeks).</li>
              <li><strong>Vaccination: </strong>  Common vaccines include Marek’s Disease, Newcastle Disease, and Infectious Bronchitis. These vaccines can be administered at the hatchery or by a vet.</li>
              <li><strong>Daily Checks: </strong>Watch for signs of illness (e.g., changes in appetite, drooping feathers, irregular droppings). Early detection can prevent the spread to other chickens.</li>

            <ol>
              <li><strong>Nutrition:</strong>  Ensure hens have access to high-quality layer feed and calcium. Poor nutrition can lead to fewer eggs or issues like soft-shelled eggs.</li>
              <li><strong>Lighting: </strong>Hens need about 14-16 hours of light daily for optimal laying. In winter, you can extend daylight using low-wattage bulbs to maintain consistent egg production.</li>
              <li><strong>Environment: </strong>Keep stress levels low by reducing overcrowding, ensuring proper ventilation, and keeping predators away.</li>
              
            </ol>
            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Hens often lay fewer eggs during molting or in extremely hot or cold weather. Keep track of these seasonal changes to adjust care routines accordingly.</p>
